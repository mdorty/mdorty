Who am I?
Hi there, my name is Matt and I’ve been coding websites since 1998.

I’m mostly self-taught. I started out by experimenting on sites hosted on Angelfire. I would “reverse engineer” (view the html source code) of web pages that I liked to incorporate those looks on my own sites.

I went to my local university for a few years working towards my bachelor’s in computer science, but I never finished (I have about 20 credit hours left).
